A quiz-app that lists a number of promises given by political parties in Norway. The user have to guess which party gave the original promise in a Tinder-inspired view, where they can flip a promise to either side, where each side represent a given party.

The app is build using [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).
